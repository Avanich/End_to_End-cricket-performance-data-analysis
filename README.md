# 🏏 End-to-End Cricket Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **end-to-end cricket performance analysis** using real match and player datasets.  
The goal is to extract meaningful insights about players and teams through data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

It helps answer questions like:
- Who are the most consistent batsmen and bowlers?
- Which players perform best under pressure?
- How do teams perform across venues and seasons?
- What factors influence match outcomes?

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and preprocess cricket datasets
- Clean missing/inconsistent values and standardize formats
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze batting and bowling performance trends
- Generate insights using visualizations and summary metrics
- Create final reports/tables for top performers

---

## 🧾 Dataset
This project can work with:
- Match-level data (team vs team, venue, result, season)
- Player performance data (runs, strike rate, wickets, economy, etc.)
- Ball-by-ball data (optional, for deeper analysis)

Possible sources:
- Kaggle cricket datasets
- Cricsheet ball-by-ball data
